    # in. This is good for running tests against multiple subnets, just make sure

    # If the ingestor is using up all of the available memory it may help to reduce
    # the buffer size. On the other hand if hte ingestor is running slowly, and 
    # there is plenty of resources remaining, it may be wise to increase the buffer
    # and writethread size accorndingly. Note that writing to MongoDB is a part of
    # this equation. If MongoDB is tipping over when ingest is run, then reduce 
    # those WriteThreads.

    # If use dates is true the logs will be split into databases by date, this is
    # best for if you have multiple days worth of log files in the logpath and wish
    # to treat each day as a seperate test. 24hours worth of data is the ideal for 
    # analysis, and using dates will ensure that tests are broken into 24hour periods
    # around midnight of each day.
